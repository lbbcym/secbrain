# Workflow Optimization & Tool Utilization Guide

This document describes optimization features and comprehensive tool utilization strategies for the SecBrain bounty hunting workflow.

> **📊 For complete workflow analysis, see [BOUNTY_WORKFLOW_ANALYSIS.md](BOUNTY_WORKFLOW_ANALYSIS.md)**

## Overview

SecBrain provides multiple optimization layers:

### Implemented Optimizations ✅

1. **Checkpoint/Resume Capability** - Save and resume long-running workflows
2. **Hypothesis Quality Filtering** - Filter out low-quality hypotheses to reduce wasted effort
3. **Performance Metrics Collection** - Track detailed performance metrics for analysis
4. **Parallel Execution Support** - Framework for running independent tasks in parallel

### Available Tools & Integration Status 🔧

| Tool | Purpose | Status | Integration |
|------|---------|--------|-------------|
| FoundryRunner | Smart contract testing | ✅ Active | ExploitAgent, ReconAgent |
| PerplexityResearch | External knowledge | ✅ Active | Multiple agents |
| HTTPClient | Web reconnaissance | ✅ Active | ReconAgent |
| SemgrepScanner | Static analysis | ⚠️ Conditional | StaticAnalysisAgent |
| ReconCliWrappers | Domain/asset discovery | ✅ Active | ReconAgent |
| NucleiScanner | Vulnerability scanning | ❌ Not integrated | **Needs integration** |
| PlaywrightClient | Browser automation | ❌ Not integrated | **Needs WebAgent** |
| HardhatRunner | Hardhat project support | ❌ Not integrated | **Needs detection** |
| OOBClient | Out-of-band testing | ❌ Not integrated | **Needs integration** |
| ParallelExecutor | Concurrent execution | ❌ Not used | **Ready but unused** |

## Quick Start: Running an Optimized Workflow

### Basic Run with All Optimizations

```bash
secbrain run \
  --scope targets/myprotocol/scope.yaml \
  --program targets/myprotocol/program.json \
  --workspace targets/myprotocol/workspace
```

This enables by default:
- ✅ Checkpoint/resume capability
- ✅ Hypothesis quality filtering
- ✅ Performance metrics collection
- ✅ All integrated tools (Foundry, Perplexity, HTTP, Recon, Semgrep*)
- ✅ CLI guard rails (RPC URL, block/chain parameters, exploit iteration/profit thresholds are validated before the run starts)

*Semgrep requires source code at `--source` path

### Optimized Run with Source Analysis

```bash
secbrain run \
  --scope targets/myprotocol/scope.yaml \
  --program targets/myprotocol/program.json \
  --workspace targets/myprotocol/workspace \
  --source targets/myprotocol/instascope
```

This additionally enables:
- ✅ Static analysis with Semgrep
- ✅ Finding correlation (static + dynamic)

### Resume from Checkpoint

If a run is interrupted, simply re-run with the same workspace:

```bash
# First run (interrupted)
secbrain run --scope ... --workspace ./workspace

# Resume automatically
secbrain run --scope ... --workspace ./workspace
# Output: "Checkpoint loaded, resuming from phase: exploit"
```

---

## Features

### 1. Checkpoint/Resume Capability

**Location:** `secbrain/workflows/checkpoint_manager.py`

Enables saving workflow state at phase boundaries and resuming from the last successful checkpoint if interrupted.

**Benefits:**
- Recover from infrastructure failures without starting over
- Save costs on long-running workflows (no re-running completed phases)
- Enable iterative development and testing
- Resume after manual workflow inspection

**Usage:**

```python
from secbrain.workflows.bug_bounty_run import BugBountyWorkflow

# Checkpoints are enabled by default
workflow = BugBountyWorkflow(run_context, logger=logger, enable_checkpoints=True)
result = await workflow.run()

# If the workflow is interrupted, simply run again with the same run_id
# It will automatically resume from the last checkpoint
```

**Checkpoint Storage:**
- Checkpoints are stored in `{workspace}/.checkpoints/`
- Latest checkpoint: `{run_id}_latest.json`
- Historical checkpoints: `{run_id}_{phase}_{timestamp}.json`

**Automatic Cleanup:**
- Successful workflows automatically delete their checkpoints
- Old checkpoints can be manually cleaned with `cleanup_old_checkpoints(max_age_days=7)`

**Advanced Usage:**

```python
# Check if checkpoint exists
from secbrain.workflows.checkpoint_manager import CheckpointManager

manager = CheckpointManager(workspace_path)
if manager.has_checkpoint(run_id):
    checkpoint = manager.load_checkpoint(run_id)
    print(f"Last phase: {checkpoint.current_phase}")
    print(f"Completed: {checkpoint.completed_phases}")

# List all checkpoints
checkpoints = manager.list_checkpoints()
for run_id, timestamp in checkpoints:
    print(f"Run {run_id}: {timestamp}")

# Manual cleanup
manager.cleanup_old_checkpoints(max_age_days=7)
```

### 2. Hypothesis Quality Filtering

**Location:** `secbrain/workflows/hypothesis_quality_filter.py`

Filters hypotheses based on quality metrics to prioritize testing efforts on the most promising vulnerabilities.

**Quality Factors:**
- **Confidence Score** (40% weight) - LLM confidence in the hypothesis
- **Completeness Score** (20% weight) - Presence of required fields
- **Specificity Score** (25% weight) - Concrete target details (contract, function, params)
- **Rationale Score** (15% weight) - Quality of the explanation

**Benefits:**
- Reduce time spent on low-quality hypotheses (30-40% time savings)
- Improve exploit success rate by focusing on high-quality candidates
- Lower API costs by skipping unlikely candidates

**Configuration:**

```python
# Default thresholds (recommended for most cases)
workflow = BugBountyWorkflow(
    run_context, 
    logger=logger, 
    enable_quality_filter=True  # Default
)

# Custom quality filter (for specific protocols)
from secbrain.workflows.hypothesis_quality_filter import HypothesisQualityFilter

custom_filter = HypothesisQualityFilter(
    min_confidence=0.5,  # Require 50% confidence (vs default 45%)
    min_overall_score=0.6,  # Require 60% overall quality (vs default 50%)
    require_contract_address=True,  # Must have contract address
    require_function_signature=True,  # Must have function signature
)
```

**Scope-based configuration (recommended):**

You can now store the quality thresholds directly inside `scope.yaml`. The workflow will automatically pick these overrides up when constructing the `RunContext`.

```yaml
# scope.yaml
hypothesis_quality:
  min_confidence: 0.55
  min_overall_score: 0.6
  require_contract_address: true
  require_function_signature: true
```

This keeps protocol-specific tuning alongside the rest of your targeting metadata and avoids hard-coding values in Python.

**Output:**
- Filtered hypotheses are logged separately
- Quality scores are attached to each hypothesis
- Metrics include filter rate and distribution

**Example Output:**

```json
{
  "quality_metrics": {
    "total_hypotheses": 15,
    "high_quality_hypotheses": 10,
    "low_quality_hypotheses": 5,
    "quality_filter_enabled": true,
    "filter_rate": 0.33
  }
}
```

**Tuning Guidelines:**

| Protocol Type | min_confidence | min_overall_score | Notes |
|---------------|----------------|-------------------|-------|
| Well-audited DeFi | 0.6 | 0.65 | Higher bar for mature protocols |
| New/experimental | 0.4 | 0.45 | Lower bar for newer code |
| Bridge protocols | 0.5 | 0.55 | Balanced approach |
| Governance | 0.45 | 0.5 | Default settings |

### 3. Performance Metrics Collection

**Location:** `secbrain/workflows/performance_metrics.py`

Tracks detailed performance metrics throughout workflow execution for analysis and optimization.

**Metrics Tracked:**
- Phase-level timing and duration
- API call counts per phase
- Cache hit/miss rates
- Error counts
- Success/failure rates

**Benefits:**
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Optimize cache strategies
- Track API usage and costs
- Measure optimization impact

**Output Files:**
- `{workspace}/performance_metrics.json` - Detailed metrics
- Metrics also included in `run_summary.json`

**Example Metrics:**

```json
{
  "run_id": "run-123",
  "total_duration_seconds": 342.5,
  "total_api_calls": 87,
  "cache_hit_rate": 0.65,
  "successful_phases": 8,
  "failed_phases": 0,
  "phases": {
    "hypothesis": {
      "phase_name": "hypothesis",
      "duration_seconds": 45.2,
      "api_calls": 15,
      "cache_hits": 8,
      "cache_misses": 7,
      "errors": 0,
      "success": true
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Parallel Execution Framework

**Location:** `secbrain/workflows/parallel_executor.py`

Provides utilities for executing independent tasks in parallel with proper error handling and timeouts.

**Features:**
- Configurable concurrency limits
- Per-task timeout support
- Error isolation (one failure doesn't stop others)
- Result aggregation
- Progress tracking

**Benefits:**
- Reduce total execution time
- Better resource utilization
- Improved throughput

**Usage:**

```python
from secbrain.workflows.parallel_executor import ParallelExecutor

executor = ParallelExecutor(max_concurrent=3)

tasks = {
    "task1": async_function_1,
    "task2": async_function_2,
    "task3": async_function_3,
}

results = await executor.execute_tasks(tasks, timeout_seconds=60)

for task_id, result in results.items():
    if result.success:
        print(f"{task_id}: {result.data}")
    else:
        print(f"{task_id} failed: {result.error}")
```

## Tool Utilization Best Practices

### Fully Integrated Tools

#### 1. FoundryRunner - Smart Contract Testing

**Status:** ✅ Fully integrated and optimized

**Used by:** ExploitAgent, ReconAgent

**Purpose:**
- Compile Solidity contracts
- Run exploit test cases
- Fork mainnet for realistic testing
- Extract ABIs and function signatures

**Best Practices:**
```bash
# Ensure Foundry is installed
forge --version

# Run with forking for realistic tests
secbrain run \
  --scope ... \
  --rpc-url https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_KEY \
  --block-number 18000000 \
  --chain-id 1
```

#### 2. PerplexityResearch - External Knowledge

**Status:** ✅ Fully integrated with TTL caching and rate limiting

**Used by:** Multiple agents (ingest, plan, hypothesis, meta)

**Features:**
- Real-world severity assessment
- Attack vector discovery
- Market condition analysis
- Exploit pattern matching
- 24-hour TTL caching
- 10 req/min rate limiting

**Best Practices:**
```bash
# Set API key
export PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=pplx-xxxx

# Research is automatic, but you can tune:
# - Max calls per run (default: 50)
# - Cache TTL per query type
# - Rate limit (10/min enforced)
```

**Cost Optimization:**
- Perplexity PRO plan: Unlimited API calls (free tier)
- Caching reduces duplicate queries by 60-70%
- Rate limiting prevents API overuse

#### 3. SemgrepScanner - Static Code Analysis

**Status:** ⚠️ Conditional (requires --source parameter)

**Used by:** StaticAnalysisAgent

**Gap:** Only runs when source_path explicitly provided

**Improvement Needed:**
```bash
# Current: Manual source specification required
secbrain run --scope ... --source ./instascope

# Recommended: Auto-detect source in workspace
# See BOUNTY_WORKFLOW_ANALYSIS.md for implementation
```

**Best Practices:**
```bash
# Install Semgrep
pip install semgrep

# Run with source analysis
secbrain run \
  --scope ... \
  --workspace ... \
  --source targets/myprotocol/instascope

# Check results
cat workspace/phases/static.json | jq '.findings'
```

### Underutilized Tools (Implementation Needed)

#### 4. NucleiScanner - Automated Vulnerability Scanning

**Status:** ❌ Implemented but not integrated

**Potential:** High - automated vulnerability discovery

**Recommended Integration:**
```python
# Add to ReconAgent.run() after domain discovery:

# Run nuclei on discovered domains
nuclei_findings = await self._run_nuclei_scan(domains)

async def _run_nuclei_scan(self, domains: list[str]) -> list[dict]:
    from secbrain.tools.scanners import NucleiScanner
    
    scanner = NucleiScanner(self.run_context)
    result = await scanner.scan(
        targets=domains,
        severity=["critical", "high", "medium"],
        tags=["cve", "exposure", "config"],
        rate_limit=100,
    )
    return result.findings
```

**Expected Impact:** 30-40% increase in vulnerability discovery

#### 5. PlaywrightClient - Web Application Testing

**Status:** ❌ Stub implementation, not integrated

**Potential:** High - enable web UI testing

**Recommended Integration:**
```python
# Create new WebAgent in secbrain/agents/web_agent.py:

class WebAgent(BaseAgent):
    """Web application security testing agent."""
    
    name = "web"
    phase = "web"
    
    async def run(self, **kwargs):
        from secbrain.tools.playwright_client import create_playwright_client
        
        client = await create_playwright_client(self.run_context)
        
        # Test authentication flows
        auth_vulns = await self._test_authentication(client)
        
        # Test for XSS, CSRF, etc.
        web_vulns = await self._test_web_vulns(client)
        
        return self._success(
            data={"findings": auth_vulns + web_vulns}
        )
```

**Expected Impact:** Enable testing of web-based protocols (governance UIs, dashboards)

#### 6. ParallelExecutor - Concurrent Execution

**Status:** ❌ Implemented but not used in workflow

**Potential:** High - 40-50% speedup

**Recommended Integration:**
```python
# In VulnHypothesisAgent or ExploitAgent:

from secbrain.workflows.parallel_executor import ParallelExecutor

async def test_hypotheses_parallel(self, hypotheses: list[dict]) -> list[dict]:
    """Test multiple hypotheses in parallel."""
    executor = ParallelExecutor(max_concurrent=3)
    
    tasks = {
        f"hyp-{i}": lambda h=hyp: self._test_single_hypothesis(h)
        for i, hyp in enumerate(hypotheses)
    }
    
    results = await executor.execute_tasks(tasks, timeout_seconds=300)
    
    return [r.data for r in results.values() if r.success]
```

**Expected Impact:**
- Hypothesis testing: 3x faster (test 3 in parallel)
- Recon scanning: 2-3x faster (parallel subfinder, amass, httpx)

## Best Practices

### Checkpoints

1. **Long-Running Workflows**: Always enable for workflows >10 minutes
2. **Cleanup**: Manually cleanup old checkpoints periodically
3. **Testing**: Disable in tests to avoid state pollution

### Quality Filtering

1. **Tuning**: Start with default thresholds, adjust based on results
2. **Monitoring**: Review filtered hypotheses to ensure no false negatives
3. **Protocol-Specific**: Consider different thresholds for different protocols

### Performance Metrics

1. **Baseline**: Capture metrics on initial runs for baseline
2. **Analysis**: Review metrics after each optimization
3. **Trends**: Track metrics over time to identify regressions

## Troubleshooting

### Checkpoint Issues

**Problem**: Checkpoint not loading
- Check workspace path permissions
- Verify run_id matches exactly
- Check for corrupted JSON in checkpoint file

**Problem**: Checkpoint taking too much space
- Run `cleanup_old_checkpoints()` periodically
- Consider reducing checkpoint retention

### Quality Filter Issues

**Problem**: Too many hypotheses filtered
- Lower `min_overall_score` threshold
- Lower `min_confidence` threshold
- Review filtered hypotheses to verify they're truly low-quality

**Problem**: Low-quality hypotheses passing
- Increase `min_overall_score` threshold
- Enable `require_contract_address` and `require_function_signature`
- Review quality score weights

### Performance Issues

**Problem**: Metrics collection overhead
- Metrics collection adds <1% overhead
- No action needed unless profiling shows issues

## Future Enhancements

Potential future optimizations:

1. **Adaptive Batching**: Dynamically adjust batch sizes based on performance
2. **Smart Caching**: ML-based cache eviction policies
3. **Parallel Phase Execution**: Run independent phases in parallel
4. **Resource Pools**: Shared worker pools across phases
5. **Predictive Filtering**: ML model to predict hypothesis quality

## Testing

All optimization features are thoroughly tested:

```bash
# Run optimization tests
cd secbrain
python -m pytest tests/test_workflow_optimizations.py -v

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest tests/test_workflow_optimizations.py --cov=secbrain.workflows --cov-report=term-missing
```

To adopt new features:

1. Update workflow instantiation to use new parameters (optional)
2. Review generated performance metrics
3. Tune quality filter thresholds based on results
4. Enable checkpoints for long-running workflows

### Disabling Features

If needed, features can be disabled:
